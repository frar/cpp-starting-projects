Simple project that provides an implementation of a systray which schedules two simple tasks (e.g. printing a string in Debug every 10 seconds with a defined periodicity).

The systray window allows the user to modify the text that will be displayed at command line.

The project is based on example systray provided by Qt official distribution and has been created through Qt Creator (QMake build system).

It consents to configure the periodicity of each task.
